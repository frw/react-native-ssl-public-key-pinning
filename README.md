Simple and secure SSL public key pinning for React Native. Uses [OkHttp CertificatePinner](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-certificate-pinner/) on Android and [TrustKit](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit) on iOS.

## üîçOverview

- ‚úÖ Supports SSL public key pinning using the base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of a certificate's Subject Public Key Info.
- ‚úÖ **No native configuration needed.** Simply install and configure through the provided JS API.
- ‚úÖ **No modification of existing network request code needed.** All network requests done through the standard [Networking APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/network) will have the certificate pinning configuration automatically enabled after initialization.
- ‚úÖ Compatible with Flipper Network plugin for easier debugging of network requests.

## üß∞Installation

### React Native
```sh
npm install react-native-ssl-public-key-pinning
```
OR for Yarn use:
```sh
yarn add react-native-ssl-public-key-pinning
```
Before building for iOS, make sure to run the following commands:
```sh
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Expo
```sh
npx expo install react-native-ssl-public-key-pinning
npx expo prebuild
```

## üöÄUsage

1. Retrieve the base64-encoded SHA-256 public key hash of the certificates you want to pin. [More details on how to do this](#public-key-hash)
2. Call `initializeSslPinning` as early as possible in your App entry point with your SSL pinning configuration.
3. All network requests in your app should now have SSL pinning enabled!

### Example

```js
import { initializeSslPinning } from 'react-native-ssl-public-key-pinning';

await initializeSslPinning({
  'google.com': {
    includeSubdomains: true,
    publicKeyHashes: [
      'CLOmM1/OXvSPjw5UOYbAf9GKOxImEp9hhku9W90fHMk=',
      'hxqRlPTu1bMS/0DITB1SSu0vd4u/8l8TjPgfaAp63Gc=',
      'Vfd95BwDeSQo+NUYxVEEIlvkOlWY2SalKK1lPhzOx78=',
      'QXnt2YHvdHR3tJYmQIr0Paosp6t/nggsEGD4QJZ3Q0g=',
      'mEflZT5enoR1FuXLgYYGqnVEoZvmf9c2bVBpiOjYQ0c=',
    ],
  },
});

// ...

// This request will have public key pinning enabled
const response = await fetch('google.com');
```

## üí°API Reference
|API|Description|
|--|--|
|`isSslPinningAvailable(): boolean`|Returns whether the `SslPublicKeyPinning` NativeModule is available on the current app installation. Useful if you're using Expo Go and want to avoid initializing pinning if it's not available.|
|`initializeSslPinning(options: PinningOptions): Promise<void>`|Initializes and enables SSL public key pinning for the domains and options you specify.|
|`disableSslPinning(): Promise<void>`|Disables SSL public key pinning.|

## ‚öôÔ∏èOptions

|Option|Type|Mandatory|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|`includeSubdomains`|`boolean`|No|Whether all subdomains of the specified domain should also be pinned. Defaults to `false`.|
|`publicKeyHashes`|`string[]`|Yes|An array of SSL pins, where each pin is the base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of a certificate's Subject Public Key Info. Note that [at least two pins are needed per domain on iOS](#additional-notes).|

## üìùAdditional Notes

- On iOS, SSL/TLS sessions are cached. If a connection to your site previously succeeded, setting a pinning configuration that should fail the following request would not actually fail it since the previous session is used. You will need to restart your app to clear out this cache.
- Third-party libraries that use `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` would also be affected by the pinning (e.g. `axios`). However, native libraries that implement their own methods of performing network requests would not be affected by the pinning configuration.
- To prevent accidentally locking users out of your site, ensure you have at least one backup pin and have procedures in place to transition to using the backup pin if your primary pin can no longer be used. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#always-provide-at-least-one-backup-pin). Further, TrustKit (native iOS library) [enforces two pins](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit/commit/7a8b422216e29df400603fb969ab24af17c6856a) which will cause `initializeSslPinning` to throw an exception if only one pin is provided. 
- You can also implement an OTA update mechanism through libraries like [`react-native-code-push`](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push) or [`expo-updates`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates/). Doing this will help ensure your key hashes are up to date without needing users to download a new version from the Play Store/App Store since all pinning configurations are done through the JS API.


## ü§îFAQ

  <summary>How do I retrieve the base64-encoded SHA-256 public key hash of my certificates?</summary>

  ### OpenSSL CLI
  
  #### Server
  
  Run the following command, replacing `<hostname>` with your server's hostname.
  
  ```sh
  echo | openssl s_client -servername <hostname> -connect <hostname>:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
  ```
  
  #### Certificate file
  
  ```sh
  openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
  ```
  
  ### SSL Labs
  
  If your site is accessible publicly, you can use https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html to retrieve the public key hash of your certificates.
  
  ![ssllabs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1888212/224491992-f315c9b0-1cd5-4ad1-a02a-b32a9fc52493.jpg)

<details id="check-setup">
  <summary>How do I ensure that everything is set up correctly?</summary>
  
  An easy way to test you've set everything up correctly is by temporarily providing the wrong public key hashes to `initializeSslPinning`. For example:
  
```
await initializeSslPinning({
  'google.com': {
    includeSubdomains: true,
    publicKeyHashes: [
      'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=',
      'BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB=',
    ],
  },
});

// ...

// This request should fail with an error
const response = await fetch('google.com');
```

Any requests you make to the pinned domain should fail since the server is not providing certificates that match your hashes. You can then switch back to the correct public key hashes while leaving everything else the same, and once you ensure the requests succeed again you'll know you've set it all up correctly!
